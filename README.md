# ses-templates

These [AWS Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) HTML templates are the default templates used for
notifications sent from the Consent Management service. The HTML template verbiage should also be a reflection of what's
documented in [Confluence](https://adatree.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQBAGw).

## Minifying HTML

HTML templates must be minified (using online tools) before being injected into the service. Be careful when minifying
and ensure the formatter does not remove necessary spaces. These minified templates are currently put into
[adr-platform-deploy](https://github.com/Adatree/adr-platform-deploy/blob/main/service-catalog/products/per-tenant-infra/stack-of-stacks.yaml).
